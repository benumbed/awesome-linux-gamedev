# Awesome Linux Gamedev

A curated list of tools, engines, etc that work well for game development using Linux (doing your actual dev work within Linux).  If anyone finds this useful and wants to contribute more, please feel free via a merge request.

## Engines
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - Works amazingly well, even has appropriate UI scaling for HiDPI workstations
* [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) - Works well, but UI tends to have issues in HiDPI situations

Unity wasn't included due to it just not supporting HiDPI at all, at least in my case.  If anyone has had experiences otherwise, please let me know.

## Asset Building
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - Full featured 3D modeling
* [Asset Forge](https://assetforge.io/) - Lego-like asset construction using 'bricks'.  Supports adding new bricks and exporting in a wide variety of formats.
* [Tiled](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled) - 2D level editor
